<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Schrödinger Hat is a collective of people based in Europe with the passion of the open source world.

We recently created our no-profit organisation in Italy.

In 2020 we started this community, contributed to a podcast, open source projects and so on.
In 2021 we dediced to create a missing conference called "Open Source Day". During the covid era we managed to create a 50 in-person people and 100 online people conference in the heart of Florence with less than 1000€ of budget.

In 2022 we made a Call For Contributors gaining 4 people in the admin team: now we are 6 people organising things.
In 2023 we get back on organising the open source day but bigger. 300 in-person people with more than 400 online persons. Huge. 10k of budget.

In 2024 we wanted to have fun so we decided to create a multi track in a two days conference with people coming all around the globe with more than 32 speakers. Still 10k budget.

In 2025..?

## About The Development of the website

This is the repository of the site https://osday.dev/ our hybrid conference. Enjoy :)

### Tech stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
