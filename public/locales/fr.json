So I tried to build it myself and, as small as they seemed, I made some steps forward and open source and the community aspect had a key role.

CRDTs are extremely versatile, making it possible to power use cases like real-time collaboration (eg.

      "talk": "Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) quantifies emissions from an application, combining operational and hardware emissions. Serverless functions reduce operational emissions by running apps on-demand, but faces cold-start delays. WebAssembly (Wasm) offers a solution to cold-start issues with near-instant startup, akin to containers but more efficiently.\n\nWasm modules are just as secure as containers with default sandboxing, yet they start almost instantly (in microseconds). In this session, we discuss why Wasm is the ideal & greenest unit of compute for Serverless applications and how you can get started using Serverless Wasm with Spin - an open source developer tool. We’ll demo running AI inferencing Spin applications and discuss how it also enables better GPU resource sharing. By the end, you’ll have an understanding of the characteristics that make Wasm a cost-effective and sustainable unit for a greener cloud.",

There is existing research about designers in open source, but it has focused on analysis of data on issue trackers or interviews with designers.\n\nThis session will cover an overview of the study, some of the key learnings and recommendations from Superbloom Designers on how to improve and progress design in OSS.\n\nMixed into this talk will be overviews and insight into the world of design in OSS tools along with some ways to work with designers in your OSS projects.",

In the traditional policy enforcement model, manual management leaves organizations vulnerable to inevitable breaches due to human error – a matter of 'when,' not 'if.' Enter Policy-as-Code (PaC), a game-changing approach that leverages code to define and manage policies, transforming rules and conditions into actionable directives. By keeping policy definitions in source code control, whenever a change is made, it can be tested, validated, and then executed. The goal of PaC is not to detect policy violations but to prevent them. In this session we delve into the practical implementation of a Policy-as-Code strategy for your organization using Rönd and Open Policy Agent, two powerful open-source projects that could help you to redefine your security paradigm.",
