So I tried to build it myself and, as small as they seemed, I made some steps forward and open source and the community aspect had a key role.

CRDTs are extremely versatile, making it possible to power use cases like real-time collaboration (eg.

      "talk": "Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) quantifies emissions from an application, combining operational and hardware emissions. Serverless functions reduce operational emissions by running apps on-demand, but faces cold-start delays. WebAssembly (Wasm) offers a solution to cold-start issues with near-instant startup, akin to containers but more efficiently.\n\nWasm modules are just as secure as containers with default sandboxing, yet they start almost instantly (in microseconds). In this session, we discuss why Wasm is the ideal & greenest unit of compute for Serverless applications and how you can get started using Serverless Wasm with Spin - an open source developer tool. We’ll demo running AI inferencing Spin applications and discuss how it also enables better GPU resource sharing. By the end, you’ll have an understanding of the characteristics that make Wasm a cost-effective and sustainable unit for a greener cloud.",

      "talk": "WebAssembly (Wasm) has seen widespread adoption, yet a significant challenge persists—lack of support for comprehensive test coverage solutions like LLVM. In the realm of blockchain, where code vulnerabilities can have severe consequences, relying on automated testing becomes paramount. This presentation delves into the limitations of current test coverage suites for Wasm and introduces an innovative solution - WasmCov. Developed by Noah Jelich and Bartosz Barwikowski at Hacken, WasmCov pioneers the field of Wasm module coverage, providing a robust testing tool to fortify smart contract development in blockchain environments.",
